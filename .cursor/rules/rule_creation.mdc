# Rule Creation Guidelines
- Make rules specific and actionable
- Focus on patterns rather than individual instances
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where appropriate

# Rule Structure
- Start with clear description and scope
- Define glob patterns precisely
- Use hierarchical organization
- Reference other rules rather than duplicating content

# Glob Pattern Best Practices
- Start with most specific patterns
- Use negative patterns to exclude exceptions
- Be mindful of performance with overly broad patterns
- Test patterns against sample files

# Security Considerations for Rules
- Never include secrets or credentials in rules
- Use references to security guidelines
- Create specific rules for security-sensitive areas
- Include security scanning in review processes

# Rule Testing
- Validate rules against existing code
- Check for conflicts between rules
- Ensure rules provide actionable guidance
- Verify glob patterns match intended files

# Rule Maintenance
- Update rules as project evolves
- Document changes to rules
- Keep rules consistent with project conventions
- Remove obsolete rules

# Agent Behavior Configuration
- Define clear expectations for AI assistance
- Provide context-specific guidance
- Configure different behaviors for different file types
- Include examples of proper implementation

# Documentation References
- Use @syntax to reference other documents
- Keep documentation DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Update references when documents change
- Ensure referenced documents exist and are accessible
