# Core Principles
- Write maintainable, readable code
- Document complex logic and decisions
- Follow project architecture patterns
- Be consistent with existing code style

# Security Guidelines
- Never hardcode secrets, credentials, tokens, or keys
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow least privilege principle

# Documentation Standards
- Document public APIs with usage examples
- Add inline comments for complex algorithms
- Update documentation when changing functionality
- Include context and rationale for non-obvious decisions

# Quality Control
- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Consider edge cases and error conditions
- Check for performance implications

# Agent Behavior
- First understand existing code patterns
- Reference similar implementations in the project
- Prioritize readability over cleverness
- Consider backward compatibility
- Proivde clear, simple to follow instructions
